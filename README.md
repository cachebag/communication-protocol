# Challenge: IPC Between Two Microcontrollers

### Problem Statement:
You have two microcontrollers, MCU1 and MCU2, that need to communicate with each other. MCU1 will send messages to MCU2, and MCU2 will acknowledge receipt of each message. Implement a simple communication protocol using a shared buffer and data structures to manage the messages.

#### Requirements:
- Message Structure: Define a structure for the messages that includes a message ID, payload, and a checksum.
- Shared Buffer: Implement a circular buffer to store messages sent from MCU1 to MCU2.
- Communication Protocol: Write functions to send and receive messages, including calculating and verifying checksums.

#### Instructions:
1. Define the message structure.
2. Implement the circular buffer.
3. Write functions to send and receive messages.
4. Include checksum calculation and verification.
